# School Data Management System

This is a Django-based web application designed to manage school-related data, including information about schools, departments, teachers, students, and users. The project is structured to handle various entities and their relationships, such as:
- Schools
- Departments
- Teachers
- Students
- Users (with custom user roles)

## Features

- **Custom Managers**: Provides additional functionality for managing active and inactive records across different models such as Schools, Teachers, Departments, and Students.
- **User Management**: Allows for user creation with custom validation rules, including password strength validation.
- **Teacher-Student Relationships**: Tracks relationships between teachers and students, ensuring that each student is assigned a teacher and department consistent with their school.
- **Department Management**: Handles departments within schools, assigning departments to both teachers and students.
- **Active/Inactive Filtering**: Utilizes custom managers for filtering and counting active and inactive records for different models.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manuhari05/school-data-management.git
cd school-data-management
```

### 2. Set up a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up the Database
Make sure you have a database set up (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL). If you're using SQLite (the default), you don't need to set up anything else.

### 5. Run Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Create a Superuser
To access the Django admin panel, you'll need to create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 7. Run the Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Once the server is running, you can access the project at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
